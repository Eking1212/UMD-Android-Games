# UMD-Android-Games

These games are from a class I took my second year of college called "Software Analysis and design". I thought it was pretty cool and fun to do, so I want to share it with you. The code compiles in Android Studio. 
I, also, helped a lot of other students on this project over the years of peer tutoring computer science.

The first game is the farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage problem. Where the user can either take the famer alone, farmer and wolf, farmer and goat, or farmer and cabbage to the other side. 
The catch is that the wolf will eat the goat and the goat will eat the cabbage if the farmer is not with them.

The second game is the 8 piece puzzle. This is where the user has to slide the 8 pieces into the correct alignment.
